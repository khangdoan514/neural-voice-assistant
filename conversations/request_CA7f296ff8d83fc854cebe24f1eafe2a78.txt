User Request: Hello, I'm calling today because I've been experiencing persistent issues with my home internet service for about the past two weeks. A connection drops intermittently throughout the day, particularly during video conferences for work. I've already tried the basic troubleshooting step, have power cycled the router multiple times, checked all the physical connections, and even moved the router to a more central location in my house.
